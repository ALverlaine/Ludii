        (description "I Pere is a two-row mancala-style game board from West Africa. It is similar to other two-row games from the region, and was documented in the early twentieth century.")
        (rules "2x5 board, the right-most hole is the store. Four counters in each hole. Sowing in an anti-clockwise direction. Play begins by each player placing the counters in their fourth hole into their store. Moves may begin from any of a player's holes except the store. If the last counter of a sowing drops into a hole making it contain two or three counters, these are taken and placed in the store. As soon as a player has thirteen counters in their store, they are picked up and sown, omitting each player's store and takes any counters in the opponent's holes which now contain two or three counters. The player who captures the most counters wins.")
