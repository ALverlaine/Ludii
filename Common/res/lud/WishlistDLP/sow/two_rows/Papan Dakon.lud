        (description "Papan Dakon is a two-row mancala-style board game from Borneo. It is one of many games that are similar throughout southeast Asia.")
        (rules "2x7 board, with one store at either end. Each player owns the store to their left. Seven counters in each hole. The firs turn is played simultaneously by both players; at the point which one player's sowing lasts longer than the others, the player whose turn was shorter plays next and turns alternate from this point. Players sow in a clockwise direction from one of the holes in their row, also sowing into their store, but not in their opponent's store. When the final counter lands in an empty hole or in the store, the turn ends. When the final counter falls into an occupied hole, the player picks up the contents of this hole and continues to sow. If this occupied hole is in the player's row, they have the option to instead place the final counter in the opposite hole in the opponent's row, and to place this last counter as well as the contents of that hole into the store. When all of the counters are in the stores, a new game begins. The players take the counters from their stores and place seven in each hole, beginning from their left. Any player which cannot fill a hole with seven counters places the remaining counters in their store. The player with the most counters fills their holes so that they contain as many of their counters as possible, with an equal number of counters. The remaining are place in the store. Any holes which are left empty are out of play for this game. Play continues as before. The player who retains all of their holes must begin play from a hole opposite one of the holes which are out of play. Multiple games are played like this until all of the holes on one side are left empty. This player loses.")
