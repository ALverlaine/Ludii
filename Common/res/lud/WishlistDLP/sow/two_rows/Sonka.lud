        (rules "2x5 board with one store on either side. Six counters in each hole. Players play each turn simultaneously. Players sow from the holes in their row in an anti-clockwise direction, including their own store but not the opponent's store. When the final counter is sown, the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. If this hole is empty, the move ends and the player must wait for the other player to finish the move before they begin again. If the move ends in the player's own row, the player captures the counters in the opponent's row opposite to the one in which the last counter was dropped. Play continues until all of the counters are in the stores. The counters are then redistributed into the holes as at the beginning of the game. The player with extra counters places them in the store. Any holes that are not filled are left out of the game for the round.")
