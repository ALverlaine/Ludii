        (rules "2x6 board with two stores. Four counters in each hole. Play may begin from any of the player's holes. Counters are sown anti-clockwise. If the last counter falls into an empty hole or a hole in either row, making that hole contain four counters, play ends, and the four counters are taken. Also, if at any time during the sowing a hole contains four counters, the player on whose row this occurs takes those counters. Otherwise, the player lifts the counters in the hole in which the final counter lands and continues sowing. Play ends when one player can no longer move. The player with the most counters wins.")
