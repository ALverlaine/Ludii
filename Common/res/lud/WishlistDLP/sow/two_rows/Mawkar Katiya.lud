        (description "Mawkar Katiya is a two-row mancala-style board game that was played by the Khasi people of India in the early part of the twentieth century.")
        (rules "2x7 board. Five counters in each hole. Players sow in a clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in a hole, the contents of the next hole are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter is sown and the next hole is empty, the contents of the hole in the opposite row of the empty hole are captured. Play continues until all of the counters are captured. A new game begins. The players fill their holes with five counters in each, starting from the left. The player who has remaining counters after this puts the extra counters aside to their credit. The player who has fewer places the remainder in the next empty hole. Play begins with the same rules, with the following modifications: Each player, during their opponent's turn, captures counters in any hole that are made to equal the number of extra counters they had at the beginning of this round. The winner of the previous round will capture one counter each time that player sows into the leftmost hole of their row. The opponent cannot sow in this hole. In addition, the winner of the previous round will always capture pieces that accumulate in the hole which contained the extra counters of the opponent at the start of the round. Subsequent rounds are played like this until one playre captures all of the counters, and thus wins.")
