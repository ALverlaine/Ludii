        (description "Gifia is a two-row mancala-style board game that was played in the early twentieth century in Nigeria. ")
        (rules "2x4 board with two stores on the ends. Six counters in each hole. Instead of owning the row of holes closest to them, players own the holes on the left half of the board. Play begins from any of the player's holes, sowing in either direction. When the last counter is sown, making the hole contain two or four counters, these are captured. If the adjacent holes also contain two or four counters, these are also captured. If the last counter falls into a hole, making it contain a number other than two or four, and adjacent holes contain two or four, the counters from only one of these adjacent holes may be captured. Play ends when each player is reduced to one counter. A second round begins with each player placing six counters in as many of their holes as they can, returning surplus to the store. Play continues as before. Rounds are played until one player loses all their counters.")
