        (description "Jimafesosh is a two-row mancala-style board game played in the Wollo region of Ethiopia.")
        (rules "2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. In the opening phase, the player takes all of the counters in their rightmost hole and places them in the opponent's opposite hole. The player  then takes the contents of the next hole, placing all of them into the hole following it, until the entire board has alternating holes with eight and zero counters. When the final hole is made with eight counters, these are picked up and the player sows as normal in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter falls into an empty hole, the counters are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter falls into an empty hole, the player captures the counters in the opposite hole. If a player cannot play, they must pass their turn until there are counters available for them to play. Play continues until there is one piece or fewer on the board, the player to whom the row in which the single piece is located captures it. A second round is played, each player placing four counters into each hole starting from the rightmost hole in their row. The player with more counters gains a hole from their opponent for every four extra balls they've captured. If an opponent has three extra after counting in such a way, they also gain a hole, and if each player has two remaining counters ownership is determined by chance. Play continues in several rounds like this until one player takes all the counters.
