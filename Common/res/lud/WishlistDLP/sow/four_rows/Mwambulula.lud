        (description "Mwambulula is a four-row mancala-style board game played by the Bemba people of Zambia. It is notable because it begins immediately by holding counters in reserved to be entered into the board on a later turn.")
        (rules "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole, the holes in the inner row are then vacated. These counters become the \"store.\" Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction in their player's two rows. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an occupied hole, the contents of the opponent's inner row hole opposite are eaten. If there are also counters in the opponent's outer hole opposite, these are also eaten, but only if there are counters in the opponent's inner hole. Captured counters are then sown from the hole that the sowing began. If the final counter lands in an occupies hole and capturing cannot be made, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. At any time during the game if a player is running low on counters, they may enter counters from the \"store\" and add one counter to each hole. The player who is unable to move loses.")
