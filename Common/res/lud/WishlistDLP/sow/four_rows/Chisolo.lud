On the first turn, sowing occurs in a clockwise direction. On the second turn, the player may sow in either direction, but must continue in the chosen direction or the rest of the game. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the inner row, the contents of the hole in the opponent's inner row are also captured. If there are also contents in the opponent's outer row hole opposite, these are also taken. When a capture is made, the player may then capture the counters in any one of the opponent's holes as well. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole, the player picks up these counters and continues sowing. If a player is losing, he may add six or seven counters to his holes. The opponent may do the same. If the opponent does not, the player may not add counters in the next game played. The player who captures all of the opponent's counters wins."))
