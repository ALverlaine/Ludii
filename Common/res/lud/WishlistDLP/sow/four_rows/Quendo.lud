It involves the sowing mechanism of mancala games, but differs from others in that the holes which a player controls are those in which their counters are located, rather than determined by the placement of the holes on the board.")

Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. Each player owns the holes in which their counters are located at the beginning of their turn, and they must sow from the leftmost hole. When the final counter falls into a hole of the opponent's, this hole and the counters in it are captured by the player, but remain in play. When a player has a single counter and empty holes in from of it, this counter leaps to the next hole occupied by the opponent. The player who captures all of the opponent's holes wins. "))
