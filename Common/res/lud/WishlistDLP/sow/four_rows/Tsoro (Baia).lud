        (description "Tsoro is a word used for several different board games in Zimbabwe. This game is a four-row mancala-style game with a series of graduated Baia, or captures, on players' subsequent turns.")
        (aliases {"Tsoro"})
        (rules "4x13-19 board. Two counters in every hole, except the leftmost in both of a player's rows, which are empty, and the second from the left in the inner row, which has one. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. Captures are made when the final counters lands in an empty hole in the inner row, capturing the contents of the opponent's opposite inner row hole, as well as the contents of the outer row hole only if there was a capture from the inner row hole. Captures from extra holes are also made, which are graduated based on the number of captures the player has made. On their first turn, players sow from the third hole from the left in the front row. This triggers a capture of the counters in the opposite holes in the opponent's inner and outer rows, plus the contents of any other five holes on the opponent's side of the board. In subsequent turns, sowing must occur from a hole which follows an empty hole according to the circuit of the holes. On their second capture, the player captures three extra holes. All other subsequent captures capture from two extra holes. Sowing a single counter cannot result in a capture. The player who captures all of their opponent's counters wins.")
