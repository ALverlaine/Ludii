        (rules "4x6, 8, or 10 holes. Eight is most common. Two counters in each hole. Sowing begins on from any hole on the player's side, in either direction, but the direction chosen on the first turn must be maintained throughout the game. If the final counter lands in an empty hole, the turn ends. If the final counter lands in the outer row in an occupied hole, these are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole in the inner row, and the opponent's inner row hole opposite contains more than one counter, these are captured and the sowing continues from the hole from which the capture was made using the captured counters and the final counter from the sowing that caused the capture. If the opponent has no counters in any of their inner row holes, the counters in their outer row holes can be captured, in the same manner.
