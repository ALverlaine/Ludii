        (rules "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Players sow in an anti-clockwise direction from any of their holes. Singletons may not be sowed. Players capture when the sowing ends in a player's inner row and the opponent's inner and outer row holes opposite contain counters; these are captured and sown in the player's rows starting from the same hole that the previous sowing began. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole but capture is not possible, the counters in this hole are picked up and sowing continues. If the final counter ends in an empty hole, the turn ends. Variant: opening moves are simultaneous until one player makes a capture. Variant: Each player cannot make a capture on their first move.")
