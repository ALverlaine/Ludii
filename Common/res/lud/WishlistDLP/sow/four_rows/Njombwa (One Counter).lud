        (rules "4x8 board, occasionally 4x9 or 10. One counter in each hole. Sowing occurs in an anti-clockwise direction. The players start by each making a stylised move. Sowing begins from the rightmost hole in the outer row. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. When the sowing reaches the hole immediately before the one from which the sowing began (I.e,, the second-to-right hole in the outer row), these two counters are picked up and both placed in the rightmost hole in the outer row. The player then removes the two counters in the second-to-right hole in the inner row from the board. When both players complete this move, the main phase of the game begins.When both players have completed this phase, the main phase of the game begins. Players sow from any hole in their two rows. When the final counter lands in an occupied hole, these counters are picked up and sowing continues. When the final counter lands in an empty hole in the inner row, and counters in the opponent's opposite hole in their inner row are captured. If there are also counters in the opponent's opposite hole in the outer row, these are also captured, but only when a capture from the inner row was also made. Players cannot sow single counters, unless there are no holes with multiple counters left, in which case single counters may be sown into an empty hole. Play continues until one player has captured all of the opponent's counters, thus winning the game.")
