        (rules "Rectangular board, divided into three sections lengthwise. Ten lines divide the outer two sections widthwide. Twelve pieces per player, which begin on the outer intersections closest to the player. Four stick dice, with front and back sides distinguished one from the other. Throws are as follows: Four backs up = kiust. Three backs up = 6; two backs up = 3; one back up = 2; four fronts up = four throws of 6.  A throw of kiust is required to enter the opponent's inner row. The pieces of the left hand player move from left to right and then right to left in the next row, then left to right in the following row, then proceeding to circulate in the central two rows in a clockwise direction. The right hand player's pieces move from right to left in their home row, then left to  right in  the next row, then right to left in the third row, circulating in an anti-clockwise direction. Pieces landing on an opponent's piece with a throw of 2 in the central rows capture the opponent's piece. A player may only pass an opponent's piece without capture with a throw of 3. The player who captures all of the opponent's pieces wins.")
