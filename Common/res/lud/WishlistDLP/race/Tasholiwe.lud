        (rules "Forty stones, arranged in a circle, with a larger gap (called a door) after every tenth stone. Two or four players, each player playing with one piece. Each piece begins in one of the doors: north/winter is yellow, west/spring is blue, south/summer is red, east/autumn is white. North and west move anti-clockwise around the circle, south and east move clockwise. Three sticks, red on one side and black on the other, used as dice, the throws are as follows: three red = 10, three black = 5, two red and one black = 3, two black and one red =2. A throw of 10 grants the player another throw. When a player lands on a spot occupied by an opponent, the opponent's piece is sent back to start. The first player to complete four circuits of the board wins. Circuits are usually counted with beans or corn.")
