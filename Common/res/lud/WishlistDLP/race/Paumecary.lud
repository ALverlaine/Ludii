        (description "Paumecary is a European Tables game from fourteenth century England. Play is confined to one quarter of a typical board. Customarily, when a player wins, the game continues, with the winner helping the loser bear off their remaining pieces, smacking the loser's hands for each piece borne off.")
        (rules "Played on a board with 12 points per side, divided in half. Play occurs only in the top right quadrant of the board. Fifteen pieces per player. Two six-sided dice. A double throw grants the player another throw. Players enter their pieces according to the throws of the dice, and they must use the entire value of a die to place or to move a piece. When all of a player's pieces are one the board, they may bear off their pieces with throws equal to the number of remaining spaces, plus one. If a piece lands on a point with a single piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must re-enter. The player who bears off all their pieces first wins.")
