        (rules "Seven concentric circles or squares. Four or five players. One piece per player. One player has a stick, which is hidden in their fist. The next player attempts to guess which hand holds the stick. If the player guessing guesses correctly, they enter their piece in the first circle or advances it to the next circle, and the stick is passed to them. If the guessing player guesses incorrectly, the player holding the stick moves their piece into the first circle or advances it to the next circle. The player with the stick keeps the until until the next player guesses the hand holding the stick. The first player to reach the central circle wins. ")
