        (description "Krida Buddhibalasrita (\"Intellectual Game\") is a game with replacement captures played in southern India in the seventeenth of eighteenth century. It is a variation on Chaturanga, which is played throughout India in different ways.")
        (rules "8x8 board. The pieces have the following movement values: Raja (x1): moves one space in any direction; Mantri (x1): moves diagonally one space; Karabha (x2): jumps exactly two squares diagonally; Raji (x2): moves orthogonally one space and then diagonally another space, jumping over any intervening pieces; Kunjara (x2): moves orthogonally any distance; Patti (x8): move forward orthogonally one space, diagonally forward one space to capture. When a Patti reaches the opposite edge of the board, it is promoted to Mantri if it is on a marked square. If it is on an unmarked square, the Patti must move back to the space from which it moved to the last row and is then promoted to Mantri. Stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player. If the opponent is reduced to only their Raja, it is also a victory, though considered a lesser one. Checking the opponent's Raja 64 consecutive times is a win.")
