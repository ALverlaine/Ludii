The same pieces as Shatranj plus: five pawns per player, one Great Ferz, which moves as a Zurafa in Shatranj al-Kabir, two Karkaddan, which moves diagonally any distance or like a Knight, and two Ahu, which move like the Jamal in Shatranj al-Kabir. Pawns begin on the fourth rank of the board. Pieces are arranged as follows, beginning from the left corner: Rook, Knight, Fil, Karkaddan, Ahu, Great Ferz, Shah, Ferz, Ahu, Karkaddan, Fil, Knight, Rook.")
