Players alternate turns placing a piece on the corners of the squares, or the midpoints of the outer two squares. When a player places three pieces in a row, either along the lines, diagonally along the corners of the  squares, or with two in the midpoints of the outer squares and the third in one of the two nearby corners of the central square, they remove one of their opponent's pieces.
