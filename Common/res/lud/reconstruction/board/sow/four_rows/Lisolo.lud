        (rules "4x8 board. Two counters in each hole. Before play, players may arrange their counters as they see fit in their holes. Players alternate turns sowing the counters from one of their holes in an anticlockwise direction. When the final counter lands in an empty hole, their turn is over. If the final counter lands in an occupied hole, the contents of the two opposite hole in the opponent's rows are captured. If both do not have counters, then the player picks up the counters from the hole the last counter fell into and continues sowing. The player who captures all of the opponent's counters wins.")
