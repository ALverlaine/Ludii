        (description "Gamacha is a term used by Hadiya and Kambati people of Ethiopia for mancala-style games. This is a two-row version that was typically played by male nobility of the Hadiya people.")
        (rules "2x6 board. Four counters in each hole. When the final counter of a sowing lands in an empty hole on the player's own row, the contents of the opponent's opposite hole are captured only if it contains one counter. When a player sows into a hole with a certain number of counters, this hole is captured by that player and sowing can no longer take place from it. Players are allowed to extend their move, if the hole before the one which began the sowing contained only one counter, they may use this counter to sow into a further hole. Also, if a hole with n counters is n holes away from the hole from which sowing began, these counters are sown and the counter in the hole preceding the one from which sowing began can be used to extend the sowing.")
