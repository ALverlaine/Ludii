        (description "Murray 7.5.53 (Egharevba 1949:70) Three rows of four holes; the central two holes in the middle row are stores. Each player owns the hole in the central row to their left. Ten counters in each hole. Players decide beforehand how many counters must contain for it to be captured: two, three, or five. If two is chosen, the first five captures must be of two counters; if three is chosen, the first three captures must be of three counters; if five is chosen, the first three captures must be of five counters. Subsequent captures must be, consecutively, of one, three, five etc. Pieces are sown in an anti-clockwise direction, sowing the first counter back in the hole from which it came. The game ends when one player no longer has any counters in their holes.")
