        (description "Shakhmaty is a Chess game played in Russia that developed in parallel to Chess in Westerm Europe.")
        (rules "Played on an 8x8 board with pieces with specialized moves: Pawns (8): can move one space forward; Rooks (2): can move any number of spaces orthogonally; Bishops (2): can move any number of spaces diagonally; Knight (2): moves in any direction, one space orthogonally with one space forward diagonally; Queens (1): can move any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally; Kings (1): can move one space orthogonally or diagonally. Castling, En Passant, and Pawn promotion allowed. Play begins by each player moving two of their pieces in the same turn, provided that neither enter the opponent's half of the board. An opponent's piece is captured by moving a player's own piece onto a space occupied by the opponent's piece. When a King can be captured on the next turn by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The King must not be in check at the end of the player's turn. If this is not possible, it is checkmate and the opponent wins.
