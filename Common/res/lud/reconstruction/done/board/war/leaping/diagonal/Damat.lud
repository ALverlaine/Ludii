Pieces capture an adjacent opponent's piece by hopping over it to an empty space immediately on the opposite side of it. When a piece reaches the opposite edge of the board from where it started, it is promoted. Promoted pieces may move any distance in a diagonal line as long as there is an empty space at the end of the jump.")
