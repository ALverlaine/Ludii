The pieces start in the following arrangement: White with two pieces in the second to sixth spaces from the top right, two in the second from the top left, one each in the top left, first from the top left, and the bottom left; the colored pieces all begin on the sixth space from the top left. Pieces are sent back to the beginning when another player's piece lands on an opponent's piece. A player's piece cannot land on a space that is occupied by more than one of the opponent's pieces. Pieces move according to the throws of the dice.
