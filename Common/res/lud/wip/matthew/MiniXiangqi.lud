Centered on opposite sides of the boards are two areas, known as the gong (\"castle\"). Bisecting the board is a blank space known as the he (\"river\"). Pieces are double-sided, with different colors and names of the pieces indicating to which player they belong. Jiang(\"general\")/shuai(\"marshal\")(1): may move one space orthogonally and cannot leave the gong except when opposite the opponent's jiang/shuai, in which case the piece can capture the opponent's jiang/shuai. Shi(\"guard\")(2): moves one space diagonally and cannot leave the gong. Xiang(\"elephant\")/xiang(\"minister\")(2): move two places diagonally and cannot cross the river. Ma(\"horse\")(2): move orthogonally one and then diagonally one space. Can be blocked by a piece next to it orthogonally. Ju(\"chariot\"(2): moves any number of spaces orthogonally. Pao(\"catapult\")/pao(\"cannon\") (2): can move orthogonally any number of spaces, captures by jumping one piece (of either player). Zu(\"private\"/zu(\"soldier\")(5): can move one space forward. Once they cross the river, can also move one space horizontally. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's jiang/shuai.")
