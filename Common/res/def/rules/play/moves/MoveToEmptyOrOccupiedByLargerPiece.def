// Defines a move from a region to any empty sites or sites occupied by a larger pieces on the board. This ludemeplex involves stacks and the size of the piece are related to the indexes of the pieces (in the hypothesis that each player has the same number of pieces). Some graphic metadata will be needed to scale the pieces according to this.
// #1 = The from region.
// @example ("MoveToEmptyOrOccupiedByLargerPiece" (sites Hand Mover))
